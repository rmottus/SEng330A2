# SEng330A2
Repo for SEng 330 Assignment 2 at UVic during the Fall 2015 semester.

The project is created in Visual Studio 2013 Community, and includes the project files to be imported directly into this program. To build the software:

1. Clone this repository locally with Visual Studio and open the solution.
    a. See this page for instructions http://www.malgreve.net/2014/06/17/cloning-getting-code-from-git-repository-to-visual-studio/.

2. Select Build -> Build Solution. By default this will build the project for debugging. If you wish to only build for release, change Debug to Release at the top of the screen.

3. If you wish to run the code from within Visual Studio, you can choose Debug -> Start Without Debugging from the top menu. You may also run the program manually by going to "\<CheckoutDirectory\>\SEng330A2\SEng330A2\\\<Debug_or_Release>\" and running SEng330A2Main.exe.
